                <hr>
                <p>The most important thing you need to do is make sure that you choose a reputable breeder. Visit the
                    puppies before making a payment, ensuring that you see the mum with the puppies and that you're
                    satisfied they are living in a healthy environment. All Labrador puppies should be KC registered,
                    vaccinated and microchipped before you bring them home at no younger than 8 weeks old. You should
                    also consider what type of dog you want: working lab / show lab, active / chill, sociable /
                    independent,
                    male / female, submissive / dominant, etc. You can ask the breeder for advice.</p>

                <p>Move anything and everything that you don't want to get chewed up as Labs will chew about anything!
                    If you have stairs, put a stair gate up to protect your things and their joints. Dogs shouldn't
                    climb stairs before four months (n.b., Wren hated stairs and wouldn't go up them for chicken, and
                    Daisy will dash up and down them any chance she can get). Make sure you know what is dangerous to
                    your dogs, such as foods and plants (see links below).

                <hr>
                <p>Firstly, find out what motivates your puppy? If it's a Lab, food will definitely be high on the list
                    as well as attention. Use that motivation to reward your puppy for good behaviour and ignore bad
                    behaviour. If you're using food, make sure you take it out of your puppy's food allowance (weigh out
                    the food for the day and then hold some back for training). Use high value food (chicken or a bit of
                    cheese) for recall (a long lead when you're out and about will help ensure its safety). Use really
                    high pitch happy sounds if you're happy with them. Look away and ignore them if they are trying to
                    get your attention with bad behaviour (whining, biting, jumping, etc). Lastly, remember getting
                    training right when they are young is key as anyone who has seen <em>Marley and Me</em> would know!

                <hr>
                <p>The most frustrating aspects of young labrador puppies for me are house training and hyperactivity.
                    House training is not fun, but the key to success is consistency and perseverance! Take the puppy
                    out every 30minutes or so: after meals, when they first wake up, if they've been up for awhile, etc.
                    Give a treat and lots of praise when they do their business where they should (relating it to a
                    keyword for training helps too). Ignore mistakes unless you catch them in the act in which case you
                    should scoop them up, take them out and give the training word you decide on. If they start going a
                    bit crazy, get their nose to the ground, which gives them mental stimulation, helps harness their
                    sense of smell and calms them down. You can do this with a snuffle mat or by scattering some of
                    their food out on the garden or around the house for them to sniff out. You should then hear a cute
                    snuffling noise:</p>

                <h3 class="chewy-heading">Chewing & Key Commands</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Labradors, especially puppies, chew anything they can find. You will never stop them from chewing, so
                    instead you need to give them acceptable alternatives. I would highly recommend getting a deer
                    antler (to use from four months), a Kong that you can fill with treats, soft chew toys and a long
                    tugging rope (if it's too short, expect to get bitten by mistake!). If they have something you don't
                    want destroyed, scatter some treats on the floor or do something they find exciting (open the
                    fridge/dishwasher, etc) and rescue your item. Teaching them the 'leave' command also helps. They
                    know if they leave something, they will get a higher value reward (a piece of chicken in exchange
                    for kibble for example).</p>
                <p>You will want to start to teach these key commands: sit, down, stay, come, walking on a lead.</p>
