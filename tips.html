                    <h3>Vs Other Breeds</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Very friendly:</strong> Labradors are very good with other dogs, animals and young
                            children</li>
                        <li><strong>Very intelligent:</strong> Labradors are very smart and will soon work things out!
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Easy to train:</strong> Labradors aim to please and are easily motivated by food and
                            attention, which makes training easy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Doesn't require regular grooming:</strong> Compared to some types of dogs,
                            particularly poodles/doodles, you won't have to worry about matted hair and cuts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Vs Not Having A Dog</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gets you outside and moving:</strong> If you need extra motivation to get some fresh
                            air and exercise, a dog will soon get you walking!</li>
                        <li><strong>Gives you someone more to love:</strong> Even when they're naughty, they are so easy to love with
                            their big brown eyes and waggy tail!</li>
                        <li><strong>Develops responsibility:</strong> Having a puppy
                            is a great way to make your children step it up - whether it is helping to feed them, train them, take
                            them out or just ensure they are safe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Helps you appreciate small things:</strong> There is something very satisfying in seeing something you love have enjoyment in such simple things, like a walk, game of fetch or sniff around a field.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tidier children:</strong> With their propensity to chew, children will have much greater motivation to keep their things out of harms way; anyone who has stepped on Lego bricks knows why this is worth a mention!</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Vs Other Breeds</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Very mouthy:</strong> Labradors will chew anything and everything. You basically have to nail it to the ceiling to ensure its safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Sheds:</strong> Labradors shed their coat; depending on the time of year, they shed A LOT. Expect spells of frequent hoovering/sweeping, and you will still be shocked on how much there still remains
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Quite large:</strong> Whilst not the biggest dog, there will come a point where you may have to say goodbye to using your boot for anything apart from the dog</li>
                    <li><strong>Needs regular exercise/stimulation:</strong> Rain or shine, your Lab will probably want to go out and/or have lots of stimulation, and failing to do so will most likely result in a naughty and destuctive pet!</li>
                    <li><strong>Not a guard dog:</strong> If you're looking for protection, don't get a Lab unless you think your foe can be licked or wagged to death!</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Vs Not Having A Dog</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It's a real tie:</strong> They will want your company, and it is quite hard to go out for any length of time without worrying about where the dog will go if you can't take them along for whatever reason</li>
                    <li><strong>General destruction:</strong> Expect things to be destroyed, people to be scratched/bit when they are a puppy (or if they aren't trained properly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Dogs are not cheap. Expect to pay...a lot!</li>
                    <li><strong>Requires time:</strong> You will need to set aside time for training, walking, playing, taking out and more. Oh, and it might be worth mentioning these may occur when you'd rather be sleeping!</li>
