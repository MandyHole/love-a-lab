                <hr>
                <p>I've never been an 'animal person' and have always been more enamored with children to be honest!
                    It's not that I hate animals, but I've never been drawn to them. I never had 'real' pets growing up
                    and my memories include: a gerbil biting me, my sister's budgie pooing all over her shoulders and a
                    broken 10L fish tank with lots of smelly water and flopping fish pouring into our living room! As an
                    adult, before having children of my own, I got a cat. We didn't hit it off, and I found no purpose
                    in having this feral animal who brought me nothing but dead animal carcuses left in inconvenient
                    places! Seven years later, I found someone who was looking for a cat, shed no tears upon goodbye and
                    didn't look back...</p>
                <p>During covid, I began to wonder if a dog would benefit my family - but I was sceptical
                    how a dog would fit into our busy lives long term. Although I had no qualms about giving a cat away,
                    a dog was another story. Then, I saw an advertisement for a charity who were looking for people to
                    socialise puppies for a year or so before they went into training to be an assistance dog; all costs
                    were covered, and it seemed like a perfect solution to 'try before you buy'! I,
                    amazingly was approved despite my lack of experience, and a few months later Wren the black Labrador
                    joined our family.</p>
                <p>I won't lie - having a puppy was a lot harder than I expected! Late nights, early mornings, house
                    training, chewing mishaps and logistical headahches became the norm. However, I loved her so much
                    that she was worth every bit of hassle. There was something about watching her take such joy in
                    simple pleasures, and her love for us was palpable. Her enthusiasm was boundless, and her greetings
                    incomparable.</p>
                <p>Alas, it came to an end, and Wren had to take the next stage in her journey to being an assistance
                    dog. I cried for weeks, and we still miss her terribly. We ultimately decided to get a Labrador of
                    our own (a yellow lab named Daisy) so now I'm on round 2 of puppy training in the space of a few years!</p>
                <p> For me, all the hard work is well worth the love of a Labrador!</p>
